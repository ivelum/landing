### Fractional CTO Service

Even if you haven't hired your full-time in-house CTO yet, the development team
still needs to make technology and product decisions, and some of those decisions
could be hard to change later.

{{< fractional-cto img="img/denis-stebunov-photo.jpg" alt="Denis Stebunov" >}}
For such situations, we provide a fractional CTO: Denis Stebunov, CTO at ivelum.
With over 25 years of experience in IT, including hands-on programming, leadership,
product management, startup exits, and M&A, Denis will help you navigate complex
technology decisions.

If you hire a development team from us (of any size, even just one developer), you
get the fractional CTO service for free.
