### Build portable learning content

Learning content standards, such as cmi5, xAPI, and SCORM, were created to make learning
content portable. This means the content can be created on one platform, such as Articulate,
EasyGenerator, and others, and then played on another, giving more freedom to content
creators and unlocking additional business opportunities for learning platforms.

We at ivelum have a lot of experience working with these standards and building additional
learning, engagement, and analytics features on top of them.
