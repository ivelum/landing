### Meet regulation standards

Healthcare software handles highly sensitive Personal Health Information (PHI),
and therefore needs to be built to the highest standards for privacy and security.
We help healthcare companies build HIPAA-compliant software faster.

We also help integrate healthcare systems using both proprietary and open APIs.
For many US-based healthcare providers, the preferred integration standard is
often HL7 FHIR, which is required for organizations working with Medicare or Medicaid.
