### It all starts with people

Security has never been just a technical discipline â€” it's a social one, too. That's
why we place a strong emphasis on training our developers and creating an environment
that supports best security practices, including:

- OWASP-based security training
- Code reviews and pair programming
- Secure dependency management to prevent supply chain attacks
- Mandatory use of password managers and 2FA across the team
- Secure configuration of developer workstations and personal devices
- Background checks for all new hires
