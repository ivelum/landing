- ![AWS](logos/aws.svg) Amazon Web Services

AWS is our favorite cloud. Based on our experience, AWS provides the best
combination of functionality, stability, and customer support.
- ![CloudFormation](logos/cloudformation.svg) CloudFormation
  ![Terraform](logos/terraform.svg) Terraform

CloudFormation and Terraform are tools for defining infrastructure as a code
(IaaC). CloudFormation only works with AWS, and Terraform is multi-cloud.
Both of them are great, and we use both.
