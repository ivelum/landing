- ![Pytest](logos/pytest.svg) Pytest ![Jest](logos/jest.svg) Jest

We use Pytest for writing automated tests in Python and Jest for
JavaScript / TypeScript. Both frameworks are powerful, convenient, and
provide a robust foundation for building a test suite for the backend and
frontend.

Playwright makes writing end-to-end tests a breeze. For years, developers
struggled with flaky end-to-end tests written in Selenium and similar
frameworks. Playwright significantly improves the developer experience and
provides great debugging capabilities, boosting overall development performance.
