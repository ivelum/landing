# Privacy policy

Thanks for entrusting **ivelum** with your information. Holding on to your
private information is a serious responsibility, and we want you to know how
we're handling it.

### The short version

We only collect the information you choose to give us, and we process it with
your consent, or on another legal basis; we only require the minimum amount of
personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your
interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as
this Privacy Policy describes. We are compliant with the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). No matter where you are, where you live, or what your
citizenship is, we provide a high standard of privacy protection to all our
users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location.

Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for
more details!

### What information **ivelum** collect and why

"User Personal Information" is any personal information that you provide
directly to us, such as your name, email address, and other contact information
when you sign up for our newsletters or contact us through our website

"Technical Information" may include information we collect from website
browsers, such as web server logs, or other log information, such as User
session or activity logs. Technical Information may be connected to User
Personal Information such as a real name or an email address, or to other
potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses.

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally
identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying
information to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our website and service.

When you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information
that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies
and web server logs, to collect Technical Information.

The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the
visitor's browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites
requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect
potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses.

Why we collect this information:

- We need your User Personal Information to identify you and to respond to
  requests.
- We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's
  okay, and only for the reasons you've said that's okay.
- We collect Technical Information to monitor and protect the security of the
  website.
- We use your User Personal Information and Technical Information for internal
  purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training
  purposes, and for legal documentation and compliance.
- We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in
  this Privacy Statement.
- If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will
  ask your permission first.

### Children under 16

Our website and Services are not intended for children under the age of 16. We
do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you
believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us to
have it removed.

### How we share the information we collect

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third
parties for their commercial purposes, except where you have specifically told
us to.

We do not host advertising on **ivelum**. We may occasionally embed content
from third-party sites, such as YouTube or Vimeo, and that content may include
ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains,
we can't always control what third parties show. Any advertisements on our site
are not sponsored or tracked by **ivelum**.

We do not disclose User Personal Information outside **ivelum**, except in
the situations listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled
Disclosure.

We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or
acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is
under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and
we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User
Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information
will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Policy or our Terms
of Service.

### How you can access and control the information we collect

You have the right to access, update, or correct your personal information that
we hold. You can do this by contacting us at info@ivelum.com. We will make
reasonable efforts to fulfill your request in a timely manner.

You can request a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly
used, and machine-readable format, and we will provide it to you if technically
feasible.

You can request the deletion of your personal information that we hold, and we
will comply unless there are legal obligations or legitimate interests that
require us to retain certain data.

### Our use of cookies

A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or
mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site.
Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting
**ivelum**.

We use cookies to enhance your browsing experience, analyze usage patterns, and
deliver personalized content. Cookies also help us remember your preferences and
settings. For security reasons, we use cookies to identify a device. Using our
website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or
device.

**ivelum** sets the following cookies on our users for the following reasons:

- crisp-client* – two cookies with variable names used by Crisp chat.

We use a number of third party service providers to help us improve website
performance and provide customer support. All of them have signed data
protection agreements with us that limit the type of personal information they
can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information.

### How we respond to compelled disclosure

**ivelum** may disclose personally-identifying information or other
information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid
subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe
in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or
rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, **ivelum**
strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to
notify users of any disclosure of their information unless we are prohibited by
law or court order from doing so or in rare, exigent circumstances.

### How we communicate with you

We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's
okay, and only for the reasons you've said that's okay. For example, if you
contact our Support team with a request, we may respond to you via email.

We may also send marketing emails based on your choices and in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations. There's an unsubscribe link located at the
bottom of each of the notification or marketing emails we send you. Please note
that you can not opt out of receiving critical communications from us, such as
emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your
notifications settings in your profile.

### Subprocessors

When we share your information with third-party subprocessors, such as our
vendors and service providers, we remain responsible for it. We work very hard
to maintain your trust when we bring on new vendors, and we require all vendors
to enter into data protection agreements with us that restrict their processing
of Users&apos; Personal Information (as defined in this policy).

All our subprocessors in the United States comply with the [EU-US and Swiss-US
Privacy Shield Frameworks](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

The full list of our subprocessors, their location, and description of
processing:

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), Europe, Stockholm – data
  hosting;
- [Crisp, Europe](https://crisp.chat/) – customer support

### Resolving complaints

If you have concerns about how **ivelum** handles your User Personal
Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may email us
directly at info@ivelum.com with the subject line "Privacy Concerns". We will
respond promptly — within 30 days at the latest.

In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and **ivelum**
regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to
resolve it. If we cannot, we have selected to cooperate with the relevant EU
Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data
protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the
Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving
disputes with Swiss individuals. Please contact us if you'd like us to direct
you to your data protection authority contacts.

Additionally, if you are a resident of an EU member state, you have the right to
file a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
