True DevOps â€“ in its original meaning, DevOps is a methodology for the whole
team and not a job title. We treat it exactly like that. Our development teams
know how to operate production environments and deploy their work safely. 
Ubiquitous automation and robust safety nets allow us to push to production 
daily while maintaining excellent uptime.
